			<h3><em>Collaborations</em></h3>
				
<p>Collaboration is an area that has sky rocketed since the beginning of the pandemic, where companies were forced with a new challenges of remote working and had to figure out to make it as collaborative as the office environment.
Collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, Skype, Nifty etc., made communication and production more efficient for teams working together or sharing ideas from different locations. It is a way for organizations to grow and improve project efficiency whilst facilitating better connection and communication. (Glossop, 2023)
There are couple of online collaborations that have to meet a team’s specific requirements, such as:
				
				
				<br>
Security systems are key during online collaboration, such as encryption, usernames and passwords and two-step verification and biometric identification are important to have in place in order to protect client’s information.
				<br>
Online collaboration ensure seamless file sharing.
				<br>
Interactions are very helpful for efficient collaboration, being able to message individual team members or groups on the platform in order to share and ideas and information.
				<br>
Calendar views are great way for companies and employees to track meetings and projects in order to meet their targets.
				<br>
Notification systems allows team members to perform tasks more efficiently and keep up with the updates and changes.
				<br>
Cloud file storage feature is a place where team members keep files, secure and accessible. Allowing everyone to access regardless of their location.
				<br>
Overall, online collaboration improves staff productivity, helps to save money on office supplies, and offers less dependence on emails.
